## About The Project

“Ceres” is a delivery app that specialize in the delivery of fresh vegetables and fruit. the name Ceres in the Roman methology represent the goddess of agriculture and harvest which was credited with teaching humans how to grow, preserve, and prepare grain and corn.

Technology used:

* Front-end: 
    <li>VueJs</li>

* Back-end: 
    <li>PHP (with MVC architecture)</li>
    <li>MySql for handling the databse</li>

Progress so far:

* Created 90% of the app backend using php and MySql for database connection
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
